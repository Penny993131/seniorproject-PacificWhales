#### Happy Senior Project :slightly_smiling_face::slightly_smiling_face::slightly_smiling_face:

## Expectation (on myself too of course)
* ~~Work Hard Play hard~~ 
* Respect all group members, **COMMUNICATE** **COMMUNICATE** **COMMUNICATE** !
* Push your pull request before *someday*

## Guileline
* There should be three branches, master, Dev and Integration
* Fork this repo once you have it, and then clone your own forked, ~~not fork you cloned~~
* Create a `remote` called upstream off the original repo, and pull from upstream everytime otherwise you won't be in sync
* After you `pull` from `upstream origin <branch>`, don't forget to `push` it to your own forked `origin <branch>`
* Don't make any code pull request to master, always to dev
* Please let Louis know if anything goes wrong with this repo
