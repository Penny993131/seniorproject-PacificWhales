# Welcome To Harmony :musical_score::musical_keyboard::microphone::saxophone::trumpet::guitar:

### **We are Pacific Whales :whale2::whale2::whale2:**
#### We See Sharp and We C#.
* Whales are warm-blooded, so are we?
* The Blue Whale is the largest animal ever lived and can grow ridiculously huge on earth, so is our project?

## Our Vision
For musicians and venue owners who need an easier way to book shows, Harmony is a useful web application that will allow musicians and venue owners to search for and contact each other. This will make for a much smoother booking process and will aid venue owners and musicians in discovering one another. It will be helpful to musicians who play shows as a main source of income, as well those who are just starting out and lack experience. Unlike other booking websites, our product will be truly representative of, and useful to, independent musicians in the Salem area.

### Status
We barely started, still on a very early stage
