# Refined Project Ideas
**Answer Questions below for projects**

* What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
* Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
* What are a few major features?
* What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
* What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
* Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

### 1. Language Learning Application

### 2. Music Gig Booking Application
This would be a website where musicians and people who own venues can create accounts and find each other. A musician's page would show their name or band name, an about me, contact information, music genre, and videos or audio of performances shared from Youtube, Instagram, or SoundCloud. A venue's page would show the name of the venue, location, contact information, some photos, and optionally a brief description of the atmosphere there and what they are looking for in a live entertainer. I would also like to display the venue's location on a map. We should incorporate a rating system for both performers and venue owners. If a musician books a show through our website, the musician and venue owner can rate their experiences working with one another. It would be useful to display musicians' and venues' schedules as well, so that they may more easily find dates and times that work when booking shows. They should be able to message each other through the application as well.


There are a few websites like this already. Although, everything I have found only allows musicians to create profiles, there are no venue profiles. This means that only venue owners can do the searching. In our application, both venue owners and musicians can search for each other, which would be helpful for musicians aren't very well known, or play shows as a source of income. Also, in contrast to these existing sites, ours would be much more geared toward the real independent music scene in the Salem/Monmouth area. I've gone to tons of local shows over the last seven years, and what I saw on these sites was not truly representative of the vast majority of bands in and around Salem. Almost all of the musicians I saw on these sites were people you would hire for a wedding, a company event, or a party, which is why I'm guessing no one I know has ever heard of these websites. 


Those that I've talked to who frequently play live shows tell me that the process for scheduling something can be a hassle, and having to go through all the steps every time prevents them from playing as often as they'd like. You need to either meet in person or somehow obtain the owner's contact information, decide whether or not the venue is a good fit for you, ask to play a show, prove that you can actually play music by sending clips or playing for them in person, then try to agree on a date that works for both parties. This can sometimes take days or even weeks. Using one application for this whole process would be much more streamlined, professional, and easy. It would no longer take days to schedule a one-hour show since all of the needed information would be laid out cleanly in one place. I know that people would use this, as I know several musicians who play shows around Salem that have complained about the process of booking a show, and have told me that an application like this would be incredibly helpful.


There are a lot of features we could incorporate to make this application really useful and really cool. I want venue owners and musicians to be able to send direct messages to each other. I want to incorporate a rating system. I want venue owners and musicians to be able to view each other's schedules to choose dates that work for BOTH of them. I think it would be great if we could also allow venue owners to pay musicians they booked through the site later down the line. Or maybe even offer paid accounts, which would boost your visibility. 


We need a way for musicians to show their work, so we will need to use the Youtube, Instagram, and/or SoundCloud API to allow for that. It would also be useful for musicians to see how far a venue is from their current location, and to view the venue's location on a map. For this, I think we'd need to use Google Maps API, or possibly a different GPS. We would also need to use something in order to allow people to make payments through the site. Finally, for the algorithmic aspect of the project, we should recommend musicians to venue owners (and visa-versa) based on who they have booked before. We could take into account their rating, music genre, how many shows they've played, where they play most often, and possibly some other factors to produce a list of musicians/venues that would most likely be a good fit.


Most of this fits with things we have done before, but there are some features here which will require some independent study. I feel that the project is big and complex enough for this class, but still manageable. And I know that this is applicable to the real world, and people would use it. Overall, I'd estimate this would be a 7 or 8 level difficulty, and would make a great senior project.
