# Refined Project Ideas
**Answer Questions below for projects**

* What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
* Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
* What are a few major features?
* What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
* What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
* Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

### 1. Language/Culture Learning Application

This language/culture learning application is more than just learning languages. What's new about this idea is that this application will give you a more in depth culture learning/exchanhe that can be applied to traveling or intercultural communication. The related website would be something like DuoLingo. However, Duolingo is a website that focuses on linguistic learning. 

This application can be useful to a lot of people like local students or teachers who want to explore different cultures for their schoolworks. For pleasure use, people can explore cultures before they travel. For example, if you want to learn some conversation in a specific language, or some do/don't do in different cultures. 

One major feature is to search for a culture/language, and output data about that culture. It may include information like things you need to know before you travel, useful conversation in that language. Another potential major feature is acting like a specific social media for exchanging culture. Users will be able to connect with people from a culture that they are interested in. It could be a search for a local tour guide or like a forum or blogs for people to interact and ask questions, share their thoughts about cultures or languages.

Some potential features that we can add:
* An API that accquires information of purchasing flight tickets
* Youtube API for travel vlogs or videos about cultures
* An API that generate a graph of flight ticket price changes

One algorithmic content that I can think of is a shopping list with conversion of different currencies. For example, if you are traveling somewhere in Europe, you can create a shopping list to calculate the total in your original currency and any other useful calculations that users might be interested in.

This topic can be very easy or difficult depending on the features that we are going to implement. For an initial prediction, I will rate this project a 7 out of 10.

### 2. Music Gig Booking Application

### 3. Make-up Tutorial Application
