What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
I believe it's always true that everyone wants to have a neat and better looking in daily their daily lives. Same to me. I really enjoy watching all kinds of make-up/cosmetic videos to 
self taught how to do make-up appropriate in different occasions. So far I couldn't find a website where will have the whole categories of differnet make-up tutorial styles. Youtube is pretty much
the main place I will go ahead to search and watch all those tutorials and tips whcih I feel we do need a place to gather all the fun and creative clips to make life eaier.
Along watching Jeffree star, Nikkie and some other great youtubers' chanels inspire me and let me realize there is a big amount of audience including both males and females.
People would spend time to wathch those videos and click those links to buy related cosmetic products. 

Having a website/app to help people to find the make-up style they want and they can fit into specific occasion would be a great idea. Provide the links and have the feature to compare the price of cosmetics
products will be highly appreciated by users. I havn't been able to find anyone has done a similar project and I feel it would be really fun to explore more funtions of it in the future. I would see the big amount of 
need from the market and everyone would love to use it if it will bring people convenience, save money and make you look better. 


Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?


I think it would be a really fun project and worthy to continue. Firstly, there doesn't exit an website could help people gather a fully range make-up self-taught info from Asian style to American style, from wedding to funerals, from Christmas to halloween, for all genders.
Make-up and cosmetics are always the trend and will update very quickly. I'd people will never get tired of pursuing the fashion. The huge market of it.

What are a few major features?
1. Using API from Youtube, Sephora, Allure, Ipsy, amazon etc..///I also need a big datebase to support this website

2. Dropdown list of a fully catogeries of differnt make-up styles.

3. Search Bar, by searchig keyword of make-up style, being able to find the specific make-up style/tutorial videos.

4. Search Bar, by searchig keyword of specific cosmetics, being able to find related make-up style/tutorial videos.

9. Have some differnrent background settings and be able to put the animation figure with your own face in differnt setting. Just for fun to make a picture.



What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.

Asp.net MVC5, Sql Server, Photoshop, Some AI techniques(Accord.Net), prolog etc.


What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
Definitely Sorts alogrithms. Merge Sort for price somparison

Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
